This day is about 2nd time for voting for president in Thailand. But in this era Thailand have so much dark power that control our to not do the right thing. even to winner can't withstand with this power.

It such a shameful thing that we call ourselve democrat but truly we are the left. We fight for 9 years and still lose. Coucil president make a vote and the result is we do not have 2nd vote for same presiden candidate.

"Nothing have change at all, but if we look back now is not the same as 4 years before" This is what i think. People is not about apart but unite for one goal. we are still fight, it not about who win now but we must focus on long term.

that what i want to tell you, you in the future that want to know what we fighting for.
